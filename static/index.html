<p><a href="/v1">MutaBind</a>Â and <a href="/v2">MutaBind2</a> evaluate the effects of variants and disease mutations on
protein-protein interactions for soluble complexes. They predict if a mutation disrupts an interaction,
calculate the change in binding affinity and produce structural models of mutated complexes.
The most important terms of their scoring function describe interactions of a protein with the
solvent, evolutionary conservation of the mutated site and thermodynamic stability of the
complex.

<p>
<a href="/v2">MutaBind2</a> is the second version of MutaBind method.
<a href="/v2">MutaBind2</a> shows better performance
for stabilizing mutations compared to MutaBind.
In addition, <a href="/v2">MutaBind2</a> can perform
calculations for multiple mutations introduced on the same protein complex.
